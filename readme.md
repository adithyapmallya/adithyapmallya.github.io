# Network Simulator Application
  This is a network simulator application developed using JavaScript. The application allows users to simulate and analyze various aspects of computer networks.

# Features
Network Topology: Users can create and modify network topologies by adding routers, switches, and hosts.
Connections: Users can establish connections between network devices to simulate data transmission.
Protocols: The application supports various network protocols such as TCP/IP, UDP, and ICMP.
Traffic Generation: Users can generate simulated network traffic to test the performance and reliability of the network.
Packet Analysis: The application provides packet-level analysis to inspect network traffic, including source and destination addresses, protocol details, and payload contents.
Performance Metrics: Users can measure network performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet loss.
Visualization: The application offers visual representation of network topologies and data flow for easier understanding and analysis.
